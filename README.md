This repository hosts an innovative methodology for extracting microscopic features from macroscopic images, with a specific focus on rust detection. Leveraging the power of TensorFlow, a leading deep learning framework, and sophisticated image processing techniques, this project aims to uncover subtle details that often elude the naked eye.

# Key Features
Image Preprocessing: Get started by loading and preprocessing your images. Convert images to a standardized format and normalize pixel values for consistent analysis.

Segmentation: Utilize advanced image segmentation techniques like thresholding, watershed, and U-Net to isolate regions of interest, such as rust or scratch-like features.

Texture Analysis: Dive into texture analysis using gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) or local binary pattern (LBP) methods to reveal hidden patterns in the images.

Feature Extraction with CNNs: Employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract high-level features from segmented images. Utilize pre-trained models or create custom architectures with TensorFlow's APIs.

Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning: Enhance model robustness through data augmentation techniques, including rotation, flipping, and variations in contrast. Make use of transfer learning to leverage existing knowledge from larger datasets.

Model Training and Validation: Train your model to distinguish between rust and other imperfections. Use binary cross-entropy loss and optimize with the Adam optimizer. Rigorous validation ensures real-world performance.

Post-Processing and Deployment: Fine-tune predictions through post-processing methods, like filtering out false positives and applying ensemble techniques. Deploy the model to production systems for reliable rust detection.
